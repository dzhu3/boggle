# Boggle Game Project
This is a project for creating a Boggle game, a word search game where players try to find as many words as possible in a grid of letters. The project is built using Python and utilizes a dictionary of English words to validate player input.

### Installation
To install and run the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/dzhu3/boggle.git
* Navigate to the project directory: cd boggle
* Run the game: python boggle.py

### Gameplay
In the Boggle game, players are presented with a grid of letters. The goal is to find as many words as possible in the grid by connecting adjacent letters. Words must be at least three letters long and can only be formed by connecting adjacent letters either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

To play the game, follow these steps:

* Run the game using the instructions above.
* Input the size of the grid for the game.
* Type the word as a guess.
* The game will validate your word and add it to your list of found words if it is valid.
* Continue finding words until you give up. The game will output the remaining words not found by user.

### Features
The Boggle game project includes the following features:

Randomly generated n x n grid of letters for each game
Dictionary validation of player input using an English word list
Scoring system based on word length and rarity
